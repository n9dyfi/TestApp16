The recent files page shows a list of file names and folder names of the 8 most recently accessed files. Just click the file name to open it. The back button will get you back to the editor page. By clicking the trashcan icon you can clear the list. The recent files list will be saved into $HOME/.texteditor/recentfiles.dat when the application is closed.</p>

<p>The file menu contains entries for opening a new file, opening an existing file and saving a file with a new name. Clicking About will display the application version and Quit will terminate the application. Swiping down will also terminate the application but in that case no warning will be issued for possible unsaved changes.

Clicking File&gt;Open will open the file browser for selecting a file to edit. Clicking a folder in the browser will open that folder. The back button in the toolbar will go back to the previous folder. The refresh button will reload the folder contents. The toolbar menu can be used to cancel the browsing and go back to the editor.
